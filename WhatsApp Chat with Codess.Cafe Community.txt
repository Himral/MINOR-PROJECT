2/2/23, 19:29 - +91 99585 10119: I did attend their office hour meet

So in that they told
That Amazon Wow is a year end program hence there is no last date to apply

Also they mentioned that after the coding round they would again open their portal for uploading resume

This is the current plan.

However they were more focused on the fact that as the industry standards changes it might also effect the Timeline and Processes of Amazon Wow Program
2/2/23, 19:30 - +91 97910 69596: So are there like different slots for the program? Like once every few months
2/2/23, 19:30 - +91 99585 10119: One has to check the Amazon Website Regularly to be updated about the program
And if possible attend their office hour

2/6/23, 19:16 - +91 97910 69596: For someone who's never done open source contribution before, are my chances at outreachy next to nil lol

2/6/23, 19:23 - +91 74172 26374: Can we not contribute before the contribution period starts? And like if we want to start the contribution in the projects now so how should we start?

2/13/23, 00:53 - Tanisha Mentor: There are a lot of pages on linkedin where they post opportunities regularly like Girl Code It Intern Freak etc., with this you can also follow hashtags like #internship #batch2024 etc. On linkedin to find posts which are related to it, look for profiles of different people from your college/community/ friends to see what all have they achieved and go forward and ask them about the opportunity, eligibility, preparation and experience. There are whatsapp groups/telegram groups which update you with opportunities.

Also add your email address on careers page of companies to get notified about certain job roles.

There are a lot of YouTube influencers who regularly post about opportunities with all details like Arsh Goyal, Saumya Singh etc.

This is something which might be a good start to be aware of where and how to apply.

2/13/23, 17:33 - +91 96530 94417: IGDTUW is eligible for everything related to girls...🙂

2/13/23, 17:35 - +91 95113 19457: Is IIIT Guwahati eligible?
2/13/23, 17:38 - +91 83680 03739: If your college is eligible,you will get mail from tnp of your college
2/13/23, 17:41 - +91 75299 19085: Ahh, no, not every college's TnP shares the mail regarding these opportunities as they are off-campus...
HRs do contact the tnp, but it's not for all the colleges
2/13/23, 17:44 - +91 83680 03739: Oh ok
I was not knowing this
2/13/23, 17:54 - +91 87997 76324: And yes
IGDTUW now competes with Tier-1 colleges only @919068946349
2/13/23, 17:55 - +91 87997 76324: It is nowhere lower than any Tier-1 college
2/13/23, 17:58 - +91 90689 46349: Okay cool cool
2/13/23, 17:58 - +91 90689 46349: Not everyone here is from igdtuw tho
2/13/23, 17:59 - +91 90689 46349: So it's kinda sad to see that not all colleges are eligible
2/13/23, 17:59 - +91 90689 46349: I said so because a friend of mine from igdtuw told me that
2/13/23, 17:59 - +91 90689 46349: Not just igdtuw a lot of colleges compete with tier 1 colleges
2/13/23, 17:59 - +91 83680 03739: She might not be knowing
2/13/23, 18:00 - +91 87997 76324: She is utterly wrong 
I don't know how many students from IGDTUW were UBER star intern in 2022
2/13/23, 18:00 - +91 87997 76324: More than 5 I guess

2/16/23, 11:34 - +91 80752 58653: We are in charge of the projects actually, the teacher they are asking about in Round 2 applications, you can think of it more like a referral. Someone on the faculty of your college must approve your candidature. Basically says that, they think you are a good fit for the fellowship that's all. 
A faculty advisor or a professor that knows you well would do the job

2/20/23, 21:15 - +91 97910 69596: Hey guys, for summer of Bitcoin
2/20/23, 21:15 - +91 97910 69596: When's the last date to apply?
2/20/23, 21:17 - +91 91986 21537: https://we.talentsprint.com/
2/20/23, 21:23 - +91 97910 69596: As in, the last date to submit proposals and the last date to apply are same on the website
2/20/23, 21:24 - +91 97910 69596: But the screening happens before proposal submission right?
2/20/23, 21:25 - +91 91986 21537: Yeah
2/20/23, 21:26 - +91 97910 69596: So when's the last date to submit resumes and the test for screening?
2/20/23, 21:27 - +91 91986 21537: I'm also aware of just this..
2/20/23, 21:28 - +91 97910 69596: Oh, okayy
2/20/23, 21:28 - +91 97910 69596: So a few days after submitting resume, do you get the test link?
2/20/23, 21:29 - +91 91986 21537: I got the link within few hours of submission
2/20/23, 21:30 - +91 97910 69596: What steps are there after the test? And will solving 1 out of the 2 questions do?
2/20/23, 21:32 - +91 91986 21537: For me I directly got to the certification round without any test
2/20/23, 21:33 - +91 94456 62222: They keep the timelines flexible like that to allow people some room to join in case of last minute stuff. Ideally you should be submitting the tests/certifications as early as possible. If you are new to the Bitcoin protocal, the learning curve would be steeper, so I'd recommend submitting early
2/20/23, 21:33 - +91 94456 62222: protocol*
2/20/23, 21:33 - +91 97910 69596: Some people had a test right? Did you have any Bitcoin/development related experience on your resume?
2/20/23, 21:34 - +91 97910 69596: Oh, okay, thank you!
2/20/23, 21:36 - +91 97910 69596: Wait, did you apply for the design track?
2/20/23, 21:36 - +91 94456 62222: I applied for dev and I got through to the certification directly too
2/20/23, 21:37 - +91 97910 69596: Oh, on what basis do they do that? Branch maybe¿
2/20/23, 21:39 - +91 94456 62222: Nope, only coding and  (open source) dev experience
2/20/23, 21:39 - +91 91986 21537: Nope dev track
2/20/23, 21:39 - +91 97910 69596: And did you have open source experience too?
2/20/23, 21:40 - +91 97910 69596: Like, on your resume
2/20/23, 21:40 - +91 91986 21537: Nope I didn't..some basic ones but not any significant
2/20/23, 21:40 - +91 91986 21537: Nope

2/24/23, 00:51 - +91 87997 76324: The platform of Virtusa is very weird 🫠🫠
I can't type without looking at my keys and it keeps showing distracted whenever I look at my keys 🫠🫠
Also the passing of test cases totally depends on internet speed 
Sometimes it is passing 6 test cases, sometimes all, sometimes 1, sometimes none. 
The weirdest part is it even shows success test cases after sometime as failed 😭😭😭
2/24/23, 00:51 - +91 87997 76324: Anyone else encountered this issue or was it just me 😭😭😭
2/24/23, 00:51 - +91 97910 69596: Anyone?

Do we have to figure out the input output code ourselves too.
Can't we get complete the function as in LeetCode or Hackerrank
2/24/23, 00:54 - +91 87997 76324: Because the too hackathons coding test I have given, I had to write  input, output code too.
And it becomes really messy and time consuming
2/24/23, 00:54 - +91 87997 76324: *two hackathons
2/24/23, 00:55 - +91 87997 76324: 🤷‍♀️

2/24/23, 00:59 - +91 97910 69596: Only asked cause they said they'd send by 23rd
2/24/23, 01:00 - +91 87997 76324: In coding assessments, do we just have to complete the function, or do we have to take care of input and output as well?
Can someone answer?
My input output experiences have been really bad 😢

2/25/23, 22:10 - +91 84312 41336: Has JPMC opened applications for code for good?

2/25/23, 22:22 - +91 96918 21842: yes , it was easy but ig there was some problem from their side, like even after optimal approach 1-2 test cases were not passing and at times it was showing all test cases passed and then runtime error. Also the count of distraction was illogical even if i look into my notebook to write it was counting but overall it was good if you know dp then you're at an advantage
2/25/23, 22:22 - +91 91502 40866: I solved only two 🥲
2/25/23, 22:23 - +91 96918 21842: its fine i solved 4 but some of my test cases failed for no reason

2/26/23, 10:47 - +91 87997 76324: If not, then I don't think we'll have any women in tech programs in Twitter now 😢
2/26/23, 10:47 - +91 96677 30960: "Cancelled" so characteristic of twitter
2/26/23, 10:48 - +91 87997 76324: It used to happen every year till last year 😢
2/26/23, 10:48 - +91 88405 88436: lol y'all are direct, i like that, i sugarcoated my frustration over this
2/26/23, 10:49 - +91 87997 76324: Twitter started a wave of layoffs
2/26/23, 10:49 - +91 96677 30960: Ofc theyre done with 80% of their workforce
2/26/23, 10:49 - +91 87997 76324: I would like to stay away from this company as much as possible
2/26/23, 10:49 - +91 96677 30960: Still managing
2/26/23, 10:49 - +91 96677 30960: Rlly curious to know their internal dynamics now yk
2/26/23, 10:50 - +91 94947 52864: This is better than Amazon taking freshers through wow and then laying off

2/26/23, 10:50 - +91 96677 30960: Wait come again?
2/26/23, 10:50 - +91 87997 76324: The things were made before the layoffs, and now they are just maintaining it.
Also the new everything is paid in Twitter
2/26/23, 10:50 - +91 96677 30960: This year or last year?
2/26/23, 10:50 - +91 88405 88436: did that happen last year?  That's brutal :/
2/26/23, 10:51 - +91 94947 52864: Yeah
2/26/23, 10:51 - +91 87997 76324: Brutal 😢
2/26/23, 10:51 - +91 88405 88436: Maybe in April. Someone told me they open the registrations for one day only, is it true?
2/26/23, 10:51 - +91 87997 76324: I pray so 🙏 
Every program is getting scraped in our year 😭
2/26/23, 10:51 - +91 96677 30960: Yeah the subscription thingy is wild, but i read this blog from a Twitter SRE about how pretty much everything is automated so they could do well with very few people
2/26/23, 10:52 - +91 87997 76324: Yes
Also, they can anytime outsource work from a third party company

2/26/23, 10:54 - +91 87997 76324: Also, at least they should conduct this program. 
Not do mass hiring but at least do normal/minimal hiring. 
What is with completely shutting down the program 😕
2/26/23, 10:56 - +91 87997 76324: Even this year, they have selected so few Google Step interns as compared to the previous two years.
2/26/23, 10:56 - +91 88405 88436: Yep

I got selected for the first season of Flipkart Runway program 2021.

The quiz was of medium level, lot of concepts which revolved around cs fundamentals and dsa. Speed is something which is very important and you need to take care of that as they select on the basis of speed and accuracy. I had 30 minutes for 30 questions. I don’t exactly remember the marking scheme but during my time people above and equal to score of 26 were selected. 
So, prepare your fundamentals well for subjects like dbms, os, dsa, cao, output based questions, basic computer based and few Flipkart based questions.You can prepare from geeks for geeks, sanfoundry and shortnotes for computer subjects.

3/7/23, 00:11 - +91 97910 69596: Idk why step is usually on campus for us, but this time our placement cell said it wasn't
3/7/23, 00:12 - +91 87997 76324: Because what I have heard is that they have already selected candidates
3/7/23, 00:12 - +91 87997 76324: Which college??
3/7/23, 00:12 - +91 97910 69596: Yeah, I heard on campus peeps had interviews
3/7/23, 00:12 - +91 97910 69596: Bits hyd
3/7/23, 00:12 - +91 87997 76324: Did anyone from your college got interview mails for step ???
3/7/23, 00:13 - +91 97910 69596: Nope
3/7/23, 00:13 - +91 97910 69596: Few rejections, others haven't heard at all
3/7/23, 00:14 - +91 6205 868 489: +++for off campus this is the case
3/7/23, 00:14 - +91 87997 76324: I think someone in this group only told that they heard from the Google team for interviews. They applied of campus only. 
Did you try reaching out to them ??
3/7/23, 00:15 - +91 87997 76324: *off campus
3/7/23, 00:15 - +91 97910 69596: Yeah I remember, one particular college had interviews
3/7/23, 00:15 - +91 96918 21842: one of my friends have the interview, she applied off campus but she was WE scholar
3/7/23, 00:15 - +91 97910 69596: Despite being off campus
3/7/23, 00:15 - +91 96918 21842: had*
3/7/23, 00:16 - +91 97910 69596: In case they have stricter criteria for off campus they would've still rejected na😅
3/7/23, 00:16 - +91 97910 69596: Here they're not telling anything
3/7/23, 00:17 - +91 87997 76324: It's March already. 
I don't think they are still continuing with the selection process. 
Cause internship will start in mid-May.
3/7/23, 00:18 - +91 97910 69596: Exactly, makes no sense
3/7/23, 00:18 - +91 97910 69596: I was wondering if I made a mistake in the form submission itself
3/7/23, 00:18 - +91 97910 69596: Cause they would've atleast sent a rejection mail
3/7/23, 00:18 - +91 97910 69596: But then many people have the same scene🥲
3/7/23, 00:20 - +91 97910 69596: Do you think you maybe made some error while submitting¿
3/7/23, 00:21 - +91 6205 868 489: Don't think so , none of my friends from college have got it , ofcourse all wouldn't have done mistakes :)
3/7/23, 00:21 - +91 6205 868 489: Don't know what's going on 😂😂
3/7/23, 00:25 - +91 87997 76324: Also, there is no way of reaching out to them 🥲
3/7/23, 00:25 - +91 97910 69596: 🥲🥲
3/7/23, 00:26 - +91 87997 76324: Their ticket system doesn't work.
3/7/23, 00:27 - +91 87997 76324: I used it once during Google Girls Hackathon time as I didn't receive the OA link even when my team mates did, and they simply said nothing can be done now.
3/7/23, 00:28 - +91 97910 69596: F, no hopes then
3/7/23, 00:28 - +91 87997 76324: If you applied via referral you can ask the person who gave you.
3/7/23, 00:29 - +91 97910 69596: Nope, applied on their site
3/7/23, 00:29 - +91 87997 76324: You didn't use a referral??
3/7/23, 00:29 - +91 97910 69596: Nope
3/7/23, 00:30 - +91 97910 69596: They had the option of applying off campus without a referral too.
3/7/23, 00:30 - +91 87997 76324: The only thing you can now do is ask your TNP to reach out to them and ask about it
3/7/23, 00:30 - +91 97910 69596: @916205868489 did you use a referral?
3/7/23, 00:30 - +91 97910 69596: TNP won't help na, they simply say it's off campus, not our job
3/7/23, 00:30 - +91 87997 76324: Yes, but referral increases chances, I guess.
3/7/23, 00:31 - +91 87997 76324: Then 
I really don't know 🥲

3/19/23, 14:04 - +91 97910 69596: Wasn't the test easy, considering they shortlist from 17k people 🐤
3/19/23, 14:06 - +91 99553 53454: Do we also get a rejection mail from Runaway?
3/19/23, 14:06 - +91 97910 69596: Will the cutoff be very high🥲
3/19/23, 14:09 - +91 70610 40501: Probably yes
3/19/23, 14:09 - +91 70610 40501: Time and accuracy both is taken into consideration
3/19/23, 14:09 - +91 70610 40501: Last year it was like 26/30
3/19/23, 14:10 - +91 97910 69596: But this time the platform gave issues too right? Like 1-2 questions unsubmitted
3/19/23, 14:11 - +91 70610 40501: Yes but I dont think they will do anything about it
3/19/23, 14:11 - +91 97910 69596: Isn't there weightage for time? Unstop says points are given according to time taken
3/19/23, 14:11 - +91 70610 40501: Just luck
3/19/23, 14:11 - +91 97910 69596: Damnn
3/19/23, 14:11 - +91 70610 40501: Yes there is, but its like 26 or 27 with good enough time
3/19/23, 14:12 - +91 70610 40501: Considering they shortlist only 150 girls all over India
3/19/23, 14:12 - +91 97910 69596: And how many get through the interviews?
3/19/23, 14:12 - +91 70610 40501: Like selections?
3/19/23, 14:13 - +91 93104 69400: 15
3/19/23, 14:13 - +91 97910 69596: Is the interview DSA based? Cause they asked mcqs, not coding questions :3
3/19/23, 14:13 - +91 97910 69596: 15/150?
3/19/23, 14:13 - +91 70610 40501: Yes DSA based
3/19/23, 14:13 - +91 93104 69400: Yea
3/19/23, 14:13 - +91 97910 69596: Damnn, that's low
3/19/23, 14:14 - +91 97910 69596: why do they want just 15 interns, even step takes more😭
3/19/23, 14:14 - +91 93104 69400: Even MCQ wala is low :(
3/19/23, 14:14 - +91 93104 69400: Clearing this is an achievement in itself.
3/19/23, 14:14 - +91 70610 40501: +
3/19/23, 14:14 - +91 97910 69596: As far as I've heard, most people got a lot right🥲
3/19/23, 14:14 - +91 97910 69596: They only have issues with the unsubmitted ones🥲
3/19/23, 14:22 - +91 97910 69596: Is the 150 post the online test or post SOP?
3/19/23, 14:23 - +91 70610 40501: SOP is not an eliminator round
3/19/23, 14:23 - +91 97910 69596: Oh damn, didn't know
3/19/23, 14:27 - +91 6200 795 390: So SOP will be submitted by all 17k students?
3/19/23, 14:27 - +91 70610 40501: No , students shortlisted after MCQ round
3/19/23, 14:29 - +91 89306 47997: Flipkart kam interns hi leti hai
3/19/23, 14:30 - +91 97910 69596: matlab it's all india also
3/19/23, 14:30 - +91 97910 69596: Step still takes more from selected campuses
3/19/23, 14:30 - +91 97910 69596: This is open to all also🥲
3/19/23, 14:31 - +91 84204 11984: True my one friend got into analyst intern role for summer only 9 people all over india (boys+girls) were selected (on+off)
3/19/23, 14:32 - +91 97910 69596: Flipkart is more meant for product roles imo
3/19/23, 14:32 - +91 97910 69596: But their APM all over India competition also takes like 10 people
3/19/23, 14:33 - +91 73762 08690: Dont worry guys
Abhi aur bhut opportunities ayengi.
Just take it as learning and age badho, also results se phle dont lose hopes.

In any case, atleast you gotto know the pattern of mcqs for future opportunities.
Many are still unaware that such things exist

Age k liye prep kro, peeche se seekho.
Forget n keep going

It was just my experience, questions from other topics were also asked to other candidates.

3/31/23, 14:05 - +91 96918 21842: but after clicking on the submit button it shows application closed for India
3/31/23, 14:05 - +91 79033 94756: Same
3/31/23, 14:05 - +91 79033 94756: Why so
3/31/23, 14:06 - +91 87997 76324: The application was out for so long
Why did you submit at the last moment/deadline 😅
3/31/23, 14:06 - +91 96918 21842: no idea
3/31/23, 14:06 - +91 96918 21842: 🥲🥲
3/31/23, 14:06 - +91 87997 76324: I think one should never wait and apply at deadlines
3/31/23, 14:06 - +91 96918 21842: I know but i got the nomination code yesterday only that's why
3/31/23, 14:07 - +91 96918 21842: can we mail them and ask about the deadlines?

3/31/23, 14:07 - +91 87997 76324: Yeah sure 
You can do
3/31/23, 14:07 - +91 78579 32256: I guess the deadline was 31st March so by that it must be *11:59 of 30th March*!
3/31/23, 14:08 - +91 96918 21842: but it was showing applicable period 24th Feb - 31st March so ig 31st March should be included 🥲
3/31/23, 14:08 - +91 96918 21842: and they changes it to 9th April suddenly and then changed it back to 31st 🥲
3/31/23, 14:09 - +91 78579 32256: not sure then!
3/31/23, 14:09 - +91 88405 88436: Someone said last year too it closed at a random time on the deadline. So it was not 11:59 pm this time either

4/13/23, 14:27 - +91 87997 76324: Got this too
4/13/23, 14:28 - +91 87997 76324: It was so disheartening for me to see that even after clearing all the test cases for all 3 questions in almost half the test time, I couldn't make it.
4/13/23, 14:28 - +91 87997 76324: I don't know what kind of selection procedures do these big companies follow.
4/13/23, 14:29 - +91 87997 76324: And they also leave a very bad impact on candidates with such procedures
4/13/23, 14:31 - +91 94947 52864: Did you write comments for the code explaining it? I've heard from a senior of mine that it adds to the selection
4/13/23, 14:31 - +91 87997 76324: I will think a thousand times before applying to such companies in future 😢😢😢
4/13/23, 14:31 - +91 87997 76324: No I didn't have so much time.
I thought we had to complete it as fast as we can.
Neither did they mention such thing.
4/13/23, 14:31 - +91 95600 68032: Broo thats so sad :( dont be demotivated tho u did better than most of the people ❤️
4/13/23, 14:32 - +91 84312 41336: Arre it's fine don't worry. U still have many opportunities, you will get something great real soon. Just keep up the consistency, and you did ❤️ a great job , well done.
4/13/23, 14:32 - +91 81044 29463: I don't really think any company has that much of time to check codes of all candidates
4/13/23, 14:33 - +91 87997 76324: Thank you 😊
4/13/23, 14:33 - +91 87919 86033: What even was  the criteria they kept for the shortlisting since this time, last year people who solved 2.5 got the mail and this year they are randomly rejecting people who solved 3 lol
4/13/23, 14:33 - +91 94947 52864: Just to avoid plagiarism
4/13/23, 14:33 - +91 84312 41336: Yea true. It will be based on test cases and rarely submission time
4/13/23, 14:33 - +91 87997 76324: Thank you 
It really means a lot 🫶🏻🫶🏻🫶🏻
4/13/23, 14:34 - +91 94947 52864: No give your best don't lose hope ❤️

4/13/23, 14:35 - +91 87997 76324: It's just that I am getting a series of rejection from everyone and it really hurts the self confidence. 
I thought this time I'll make it cause I did everything right.
But ... my bad luck 😢😢
4/13/23, 14:36 - +91 79033 94756: Don't overthink ananya, even I did all three and got a rejection. Really don't know how the selection procedure was. But all we have to do is keep doing and things will fall in place
4/13/23, 14:36 - +91 87997 76324: Yesss
We will make it 💪💪
4/13/23, 14:37 - +91 6205 868 489: ++
4/13/23, 14:37 - +91 81044 29463: Many more opportunities to come!
All your seniors have gone through this.
Don't lose hope and be patient ❤️
4/13/23, 14:48 - +91 84204 11984: None of the oas take comments into consideration

4/14/23, 22:26 - +91 84312 41336: Collection of questions 👆🏻asked previously.
4/14/23, 22:27 - +91 84312 41336: Also note that for every question you will get 30 seconds to think and 2 minutes to speak. You will be having 1 attempt extra for each question but try to give the best in 1st attempt only as if you choose for 2nd attempt that will get autosubmit and you won't get a chance to select among the two attempts.
P.S : at our time we had 2 questions in that round.

Personal suggestion : if you get a question where you can use the points related to the domain in which JPMC works do include them it can create a good impact. Be confident and don't be too fast otherwise it will reflect as you learned a script.

4/19/23, 00:51 - +91 97746 56225: Some general tips:
1) Describe a situation that is personal to u and not something u have copied

2) Have a proper introduction and conclusion.  Write ur essays in paragraphs.

3) Run your essays through Grammarly for checking any grammatical errors.

4) Try to showcase events that bring out ur strengths and things that make u unique. 

5) Point out what you have learned from the adversity.

6) For the second question, write down what you think are the problems faced by minority in tech. Research through various articles. Add on your own personal experience that u faced as a women in STEM. Talk about what you think will help mitigate this disparity. Also add on what u have done or plan to do to deal with this inequity. 

7) See that your essays answer all the points mentioned in the questions.

U can start writing ur essays. Other scholars and I can review ur essays. You can DM us.

4/19/23, 00:53 - +91 97746 56225: Round 1) Essay and resume shortlisting

Round 2) Coding contest

Round 3) Interview
4/19/23, 00:54 - +91 97119 69311: Ok dii ...thanks a lot ✨
4/19/23, 00:56 - +91 97746 56225: The first question gave u a broader spectrum to write on

U can write about some tech issue or something personal that shows ur strength. Talk about something that can help you describe yourself the best. 

At the end of the day, they wanna know about you through your essays. So be as original and human as possible.

4/22/23, 22:05 - +91 87002 89032: Greetings everyone!

The last few weeks of my college life are going on and looking back I made lots of fun memories. We all do right?

I also achieved several important milestones that I always dreamt of. One of them which is very close to my heart is working at Google as a SWE.

The internships and placement season for my junior batches are coming up very soon! I was at the exact same place, with mixed feelings of excitement and anxiety. 
But, It’s time to gear up now and work hard for the dreams we and our parents have seen for us.

So, to help you start, I’ll be sharing my complete “Placement Story” on Explorin Institute of Dreamers ’s Podcast Live on 23rd April, 9:30PM.

Also, those who will attend the podcast will get a special chance to get 100% placement ready directly under my mentorship! Cool right?

It’s going to be an exceptional opportunity for 2nd, 3rd year college students to learn, grow and get a chance to learn directly under my mentorship.

Book your seat for the podcast!  See y'll there!

5/5/23, 17:50 - +91 75320 76662: I'm considering soft computing and computer vision as of now but idk if these subjects are easy. If anyone has studied them before help me here. Or have any better suggestion.
5/5/23, 17:54 - +91 84204 11984: If you are into nlp then take that or if you're into cv then take digital img processing & cv
Also soft computing is another ml based subj but a bit on the side of research
5/5/23, 17:57 - +91 98117 26826: computer vision
5/5/23, 17:58 - +91 98117 26826: computer vision will help you in projects and is a good skill to have
5/5/23, 17:58 - +91 98117 26826: but nlp is very trending these days because of chatgpt and LLMs
5/5/23, 17:58 - +91 75320 76662: I need to pick 2 and I haven't tried nlp or computer vision just basic ml models and things
5/5/23, 17:59 - +91 98117 26826: I think if your domain is ml you should choose these two because you'll have to do these eventually
5/5/23, 18:00 - +91 6386 845 062: nlp is hard to score into but if u are excited for it got for it.
And computer vision is scoring and great to study
5/5/23, 18:02 - +91 75320 76662: okay.... yeah I felt that after reading the nlp syllabus almost everything was new to me
5/5/23, 18:03 - +91 75320 76662: Thanku soo much @918420411984 @916386845062 @919811726826 ❤️❤️
5/5/23, 18:03 - +91 75320 76662: Okay by all of your suggestions I'm sure about one elective now 
That is computer vision 
But I still need to choose one more
5/5/23, 18:15 - +91 90581 10005: ++
I had computer vision as a subject earlier.

But since you're into ml try going for nlp, you'll eventually have to study it in the future if you continue with ml.

5/14/23, 20:38 - +91 87997 76324: Honor tab milta hain jab aapko aapke efforts ke liye recognize kiya jaye.

5/14/23, 20:39 - +91 87997 76324: Conference attend karne ki scholarship milna iss not honor and award.
5/14/23, 20:40 - +91 87997 76324: Usmein aap justify karte ho ki aapko scholarship kyon milne chahiye. Usmein aapko koi aapke efforts ke liye recognize nhi kar raha.

5/15/23, 14:27 - +91 83030 35360: It might be a glitch from their side...just go on the section where you have selected undergrad and select the same option once again
5/15/23, 14:27 - +91 83030 35360: It might start showing then

5/16/23, 17:41 - +91 76079 04604: Actually they are too lengthy, i have less time, so can I go for Aditya Verma only?
5/16/23, 17:46 - +91 84312 41336: Yea sure 👍🏻
Striver has thought 4 approaches for single question and space optimisation solutions which no one teaches. He writes code for all problems and runs it so they are lengthy. But Aditya Verma just explains in paper. If you want to cover it quick you can go for that. He teaches nicely as well.

5/30/23, 17:29 - +91 6396 610 052: Last year, my team had participated in ggh , we went till the semi-final phase. 
The first round was coding. So last time each member needs to give the ggc and then the avg score of team members considered as a final one. 
Every team member received diff. Questions
-> there were 2dsa questions the level was medium. ( 1200-1400 codeforces rating quest. )
The topics in my case were array and tree .
Tips:-
->try to solve both the quest.
 ->You can practice previously asked quest.

5/30/23, 19:01 - +91 99562 64774: Yeah that's why we're confused because on their site it is said that there will be a team of 3 members
5/30/23, 19:11 - +91 83108 89759: Once people are selected, then there is one more round which is learning Cohort something after that there will be problem statements. Thus, team formation will be anyways after the coding round or after learning Cohort mostly

6/9/23, 11:39 - +91 90689 46349: How much cgpa is considered safe? Do companies actually have a cgpa cutoff? If yes then which companies?
6/9/23, 11:39 - +91 90689 46349: Specifically for internship opportunities in 2nd year
6/9/23, 11:41 - +91 94947 52864: 6.5+ = you will be eligible for some companies for placements and only skill set can get u a placement 

7+ = you will be eligible to sit for any company for campus placements and you have to skilled enough with good resume and DSA

8+ = you have a decent cgpa, all you need to do is focus on DSA and core fundamentals (cs fundamentals)

8.5+ = you will be eligible for almost every company, some times your resume stands out because of your cgpa only. Focus on necessary things and you will clear the interview

9 and above : you have done an exceptional job. I know how much you worked on academics. But bro, since already u have enough gpa, u need not focus on it now at all....
Sometimes companies which look at cgpa, they might look u stand out from others....
Focus on DSA , and job will be urs with a nice package too


However CGPA is just a eligibility criteria and not the one which decides whether u get a good placement or not.
But having a good cgpa will only help you but not degrade u. So, whatever the cgpa is, just work hard and show the companies why they need to hire you and put something in your resume which stands you out from others

6/9/23, 17:38 - +91 89254 67503: I think i got selected because I am in 1st year idk the criteria
6/9/23, 17:39 - +91 86387 35551: All test cases pass?
6/9/23, 17:39 - +91 77370 66359: I solved both but still rejected🥲
6/9/23, 17:39 - +91 89254 67503: no it's was a partial submission
6/9/23, 17:39 - +91 99036 65035: i also solved 1+1partial and got rejected.
6/9/23, 17:39 - +91 97910 69596: F

6/9/23, 17:39 - +91 90653 22988: I got the selection mail for ggh as well.
6/9/23, 17:39 - +91 89254 67503: like 7 test cases passed
6/9/23, 17:40 - +91 77370 66359: Yes all test cases passed
6/9/23, 17:41 - +91 77370 66359: I think they prefer 1st year
6/9/23, 17:41 - +91 87997 76324: What was the criteria of selection or rejection???
6/9/23, 17:41 - +91 97910 69596: Damnn
6/9/23, 17:41 - +91 97910 69596: Still rejection? Very weird
6/9/23, 17:42 - +91 79086 54711: Exactly
6/9/23, 17:42 - +91 79086 54711: How far I know they selected on the basis of resume and performance
6/9/23, 17:42 - +91 79086 54711: They wrote that in my mail
6/9/23, 17:42 - +91 97910 69596: Is everyone who got selected here from year 1?
6/9/23, 17:42 - +91 87997 76324: I think then it was 
import random 
student_list.random()

6/9/23, 17:42 - +91 99924 38900: ++
6/9/23, 17:43 - +91 77370 66359: 💯
6/9/23, 17:43 - +91 97910 69596: Do you think there were any stand outs in your resume? Like a very good internship or something related to Google
6/9/23, 17:43 - +91 97910 69596: Because it's very weird that people with both solved were rejected🥲🥲
6/9/23, 17:43 - +91 79086 54711: No I am in first year , I don't have any good internship experience or project as of now 🫠
6/9/23, 17:44 - +91 79086 54711: Actually....
6/9/23, 17:44 - +91 89254 67503: I get it, I'm surprised
6/9/23, 17:44 - +91 99036 65035: i am a google we scholar, solved 1.5, in first year, still rejected:)
6/9/23, 17:44 - +91 6396 610 052: It might be based on performance+ year + resume.
6/9/23, 17:44 - +91 97910 69596: Oo
Still, first year mein this is a great opportunity
Congratulations ❤️
6/9/23, 17:45 - +91 79086 54711: Thanks a lot
6/9/23, 17:45 - +91 87997 76324: Also maybe how early a person attempted the test. Cause questions were same for everyone in the test.
6/9/23, 17:46 - +91 74848 88770: I too got a selection mail
6/9/23, 17:46 - +91 77370 66359: Congratulations🥳
6/9/23, 17:46 - +91 97910 69596: Makes sense
6/9/23, 17:47 - +91 84202 83936: Then why keep the window of 12hr. Doesn't make any sense
6/9/23, 17:47 - +91 87997 76324: Google is Google
6/9/23, 17:48 - +91 87997 76324: I also didn't have any expectation from it.
Because I always get rejected in any opportunity by Google
6/9/23, 17:48 - +91 79086 54711: Test is for 1 hr only nah !
6/9/23, 17:48 - +91 74046 04803: One of my friend solved both , with all teat cases passes idk why didnt she get🥲
6/9/23, 17:48 - +91 79086 54711: Maybe they're calculating the time
6/9/23, 17:48 - +91 97910 69596: Same bro same🥲
6/9/23, 17:50 - +91 94947 52864: or maybe they have a plag check like codechef
6/9/23, 17:50 - +91 94947 52864: where they have strict criteria

6/9/23, 18:36 - +91 82938 18291: It was random....relax😂
6/9/23, 18:37 - +91 96530 94417: Yes... Now after step and this...i believe the same...
6/9/23, 18:39 - +91 94947 52864: Step was random too
6/9/23, 18:39 - +91 94947 52864: ?
6/9/23, 18:40 - +91 87997 76324: Unfortunately yess
6/9/23, 18:41 - +91 78279 48194: yeah in the time line it was mentioned end of May
6/9/23, 18:43 - +91 70678 80448: true
6/9/23, 18:46 - +91 82938 18291: Yess

6/9/23, 18:50 - +91 81044 29463: Just a request as a person who is going to start with final year now:

Let's not call everything random and congratulate others and appreciate their hard work instead.

I know continuous rejections are very frustrating but let's not forget to clap for people until our time comes!  ❤️
6/9/23, 18:56 - +91 78074 19582: I also got selected mail 
And I am going to start with my final year 🫠
6/9/23, 18:56 - +91 70678 80448: Congratulations ✨✨
6/9/23, 18:57 - +91 83030 35360: Congratulations to everyone who got selected 🙌
6/9/23, 18:57 - +91 87997 76324: Yes 
Even we before we never questioned the hard work of others as the assessments and processes involved are not easy.

With this random, we are trying to point out the criteria followed by companies that remain non transparent.
6/9/23, 18:58 - +91 87997 76324: Yess
Congratulations to all those who got selected 🥳
6/9/23, 18:59 - +91 84202 83936: Just a one liner as to which criterias we did not meet for selection could really help a person out as we are all students and we are all learning. Atleast they could take such initiatives.
6/9/23, 19:00 - +91 87997 76324: Yes, like outreachy provided the feedback on what didn't work out or needs improvement in the first round selection email.
6/9/23, 19:00 - +91 84202 83936: Exactly.
6/9/23, 19:01 - +91 87997 76324: Even many open source programs do that.
6/9/23, 19:01 - +91 83681 06137: This message was deleted
6/9/23, 19:01 - +91 94947 52864: But it's hard for them to spend so much time
6/9/23, 19:02 - +91 87997 76324: Yeah
I think they should automate this process with AI.
Like for all rejected participants they can put a tag for reason for selection and then AI will generate emails automatically.
6/9/23, 19:02 - +91 87997 76324: *rejection
6/9/23, 19:03 - +91 84202 83936: These initiatives are to help students right. For working professionals it's fine they don't need to put in extra efforts but when you're taking efforts to help students I think atleast a one liner as to why rejection happened can help a lot of students out.
6/9/23, 19:03 - +91 83030 35360: Let us make a project on this😂😂
6/9/23, 19:04 - +91 99170 34947: Good idea🤣🤣🤣❤️
6/9/23, 19:04 - +91 87997 76324: Yesss
6/9/23, 19:05 - +91 94947 52864: Take patent quickly😂

6/9/23, 19:07 - +91 87997 76324: Aaye aaye captain 🫡🫡
6/9/23, 19:10 - +91 84204 11984: 1st round of outreachy is an essay round
and no essay rounds give personalized feedback because practically it's not possible
even mlh doesn't give personalized feedback from essay round

feedback on an essay is indirectly mentioning what's missing in your essay and that gives a direct hint on what you should write (which is again impartial because others who apply for the first time will not know whereas someone who applied once will know what exactly to write)
6/9/23, 19:10 - +91 84204 11984: those os progs may have very less applicants
6/9/23, 19:11 - +91 87997 76324: No
I said they tell that either you need to work on your essays. 
Or the timeline didn't match.
6/9/23, 19:11 - +91 94947 52864: By the way what happened to your outreachy as far as I remember you made it the first round
6/9/23, 19:11 - +91 87997 76324: MLH do give.
I think you are mistaken for MLH.
6/9/23, 19:12 - +91 84204 11984: why do they need to say your timeline hasn't matched
I think you can directly figure it out if you have checked your academic calender once before applying
It's the responsibility of every candidate to check their own eligibility before applying
6/9/23, 19:13 - +91 84204 11984: I have applied to mlh almost 5 times, and for every essay rejection they send the same email to everyone 😅
6/9/23, 19:13 - +91 87997 76324: But they tell na you got rejected because of essays
6/9/23, 19:14 - +91 98181 26297: Linkedin Talent community waala fill kr diya kya?
6/9/23, 19:14 - +91 84204 11984: 1st round is only essay checking
so if you get rejection in 1st round it means for essays there is no 2nd thought here

6/9/23, 19:15 - +91 74848 88770: I had a doubt regarding that... In the university name, there are two options if our university is not listed, one is Others-International and another is Others-US 
Which option should we select?
6/9/23, 19:16 - +91 98181 26297: Other international
6/9/23, 19:16 - +91 98181 26297: I filled

6/9/23, 19:17 - +91 84204 11984: 1st week of evaluation is for essays
if you get rejection within 1 week of starting of evaluation of your application - it means essays

2nd week is of project
if you get rejection within 2 week of starting of evaluation of your application - it means the project

6/9/23, 20:18 - +91 96939 27655: Do u remember the topics or have written anywhere??
6/9/23, 20:20 - +91 84312 41336: Do you want to prepare for endsems or the interviews ?

6/9/23, 20:21 - +91 93304 10547: Umm no actually i haven't written down whatever was less... But I would suggest you can check Silerschatz or any standard ppt for the important topics
6/9/23, 20:22 - +91 96939 27655: Okay thanks
6/9/23, 20:23 - +91 84312 41336: I would recommend a playlist in love babbar's channel for that. It is more interview oriented. 

Gate smashers is great too but they help in endsems and gate preparation. 
Also love babbar's notes ia good as well. Go through OS bedtime stories for the last moment preparation and gfg archives and interviewbit for company specific questions.

6/17/23, 00:47 - +91 96939 27655: **Introducing Omni-clied**

Omni (or Omni-CLI) is a powerful command-line interface (CLI) tool designed to streamline the process of creating fully functional Node.js servers and React.js applications. With Omni, you can generate server-side code that comes prepackaged with essential features like Google OAuth or customizable JSON Web Token (JWT) authentication and user models.

By leveraging Omni's intuitive and efficient CLI commands, developers can rapidly scaffold and initialize new projects, saving valuable time and effort. Whether you're starting a new web application or adding server functionality to an existing project, Omni empowers you to quickly set up secure and scalable server-side infrastructure.

Omni's seamless integration with Node.js and React.js allows developers to effortlessly create the server and client components required for modern web applications. The generated server code includes robust authentication options, such as Google OAuth or the flexibility to implement your own JWT-based authentication system. This makes it easy to authenticate and manage user accounts within your application.

With Omni, you can focus more on building the core features of your application rather than spending time on repetitive setup tasks. By automating the process of generating server-side and client-side code, Omni enables developers to jumpstart their projects and deliver high-quality applications faster.

6/21/23, 19:16 - +91 98983 13121: Last year it was a MCQ test of 70 mins. It had 7 sections: 
• Physics
• Chemistry
• Mathematics
• Computer science
• Electrical Engineering
• Electronics
• Mechanical

Questions were doable mostly. Difficulty level varies based upon the Semester you are currently in right now. Ie. Students from sem6 will have higher difficulty questions than that of Sem4.  No negative marking was there.


I wasn't able to clear this round because I guess other people were faster. Only 30 people per region qualify for the finals as far as I remember.

If anyone is attempting the test this time, try to answer quickly (definitely with accuracy) 

Hope this helps!

6/22/23, 20:23 - +91 87919 86033 changed their phone number to a new number. Tap to message or add the new number.
6/22/23, 21:20 - +91 6396 610 052: This was the reply I got from one of ml engineers at Google ---> 
My ml interview was mostly mathematical. 
Knowing the match behind algos is important. 
Having skills around data is important 
They won't ask you to write a model using a scikit learn library because let's face it. They don't use it much them selves. Google has its own tools and own packages and own libraries. 
So the only thing u should focus on is the concept. 
They may ask you to write algorithms from scratch using numpy. 
U can practice some basic one like that. 

My ML interview was so good one of the best experiences I had Interacting with my interviewer. 
I was being checked on my knowledge not some library which lets face it, we all just google when we have to use it.
6/22/23, 21:35 - +91 94947 52864: thank you

6/27/23, 20:20 - +91 88405 88436: please share the screenshot of that reply. And how to know who is the team leader, I don't think there was an option to mention that on the form?
6/27/23, 20:21 - +91 84484 11345: Yeah same
6/27/23, 20:21 - +91 98261 60147: the joint email id they asked i believe
6/27/23, 20:22 - +91 88405 88436: but we created a new one for it, that has nothing to do with any of the team member's details
6/27/23, 20:22 - +91 84484 11345: Can you please share the ss
6/27/23, 20:22 - +91 98261 60147: i mean, i guesss you'll get link on that. and you can attempt it through that id only
6/27/23, 20:23 - +91 84484 11345: That is an obvious thing, 
What about the instructions? How many people have to attempt it ? Is it collective or not ? 😫
6/27/23, 20:24 - +91 88405 88436: Please send the ss of the reply 🫠
6/27/23, 20:24 - +91 87261 80503: I think all the team members  have to give the test through team mail I'd only , at the same time
6/27/23, 20:24 - +91 70865 23782: Sorry ....for the misunderstanding!!! Some of my frnd got confused!!

6/27/23, 20:29 - +91 88405 88436: By reply i mean, replies to the email you would have sent to them regarding this issue. Not that
6/27/23, 20:47 - +91 97189 99144: Hey in the code with Cisco online assessment do all the team
Mates have to be present in a single room ?
6/27/23, 20:48 - +91 97189 99144: Like they need to be at one place ?
6/27/23, 20:49 - +91 99170 34947: Me
6/27/23, 20:49 - +91 79746 45608: According to the mail.. Yes
6/27/23, 21:12 - +91 82391 05885: Did everyone got this?
6/27/23, 21:22 - +91 73006 62423: What if one of the teammates cannot be present in the same place since they're in a different state- would we be disqualified
6/27/23, 21:23 - +91 79746 45608: Most of us are not together..
6/27/23, 21:32 - +91 90456 89867: Yaa
6/27/23, 21:32 - +91 90456 89867: This shouldn’t be a rule if cross college teams are allowed
6/27/23, 21:46 - +91 78279 48194: <Media omitted>
6/27/23, 21:46 - +91 78279 48194: we can use screen sharing
6/27/23, 21:49 - +91 73559 09936: Anybody knows about the question pattern for Cisco tomorrow?
6/27/23, 21:50 - +91 6205 868 489: ++
6/27/23, 21:51 - +91 84519 90784: So does only one person has to submit the test?
6/27/23, 21:51 - +91 73559 09936: Anybody who has seen it in mock?
6/27/23, 21:51 - +91 73559 09936: It's via the team I'd only
6/27/23, 21:51 - +91 73559 09936: So yeah
6/27/23, 21:53 - +91 78279 48194: yes as far as I have understood, if you've got the OA link, you will login and share your OA screen w your remote team mates so that they can help you.
6/27/23, 21:53 - +91 78279 48194: you'll be submitting the test
6/27/23, 22:17 - +91 96699 43334: Any idea abt when the results of JPMC code for good will be out ?
6/27/23, 22:20 - +91 76079 04604: They are already out

6/28/23, 07:46 - +91 6206 942 551: what  is the time complexity of

 " bool searchMatrix(vector<vector<int>>& matrix, int target) {
       int i =0;
       int j= matrix[0].size() -1 ;
       while( i<= matrix.size()-1 and j>=0)
       {
           if(matrix[i][j]== target)
           return true;

           else if ( matrix[i][j]> target)
           {
               j--;
           }

           else
           i++;
       }

       return false;
    }"
6/28/23, 07:47 - +91 6206 942 551: can anyone pls tell with explanation
6/28/23, 07:59 - +91 6396 610 052: O(rows+cols)
6/28/23, 08:01 - +91 6206 942 551: How.
6/28/23, 08:04 - +91 6396 610 052: Coz you're performing a search in both rows and cols like either you're moving in a row(i++) or in a col(j--). So in worst case the time complexity will be this
6/28/23, 08:06 - +91 6206 942 551: Okkay... thanks
6/28/23, 09:26 - +91 89254 67503: anyone heard back from ggh for round 2 results?
6/28/23, 09:28 - +91 96267 88977: Just for clarification.. can we do it using WebEx meeting?? For Cisco
6/28/23, 09:32 - +91 70939 06060: https://salesforce.wd12.myworkdayjobs.com/External_Career_Site/job/India---Hyderabad/Intern_JR203122-2
6/28/23, 09:32 - +91 70939 06060: Is this different to the one you guys applied for this week?
6/28/23, 09:32 - +91 70939 06060: 2025 batch
6/28/23, 09:47 - +91 99037 85230: no its the same
6/28/23, 10:01 - +91 91237 70650: Yes
6/28/23, 10:17 - +91 98106 72030: Yes
6/28/23, 10:17 - +91 98737 05723: What we have to fill in degree in Salesforce form..there is no option for BTech?? <This message was edited>
6/28/23, 10:34 - +91 79052 00091: BS
6/28/23, 10:39 - +91 98737 05723: Ok thanks
6/28/23, 11:15 - +91 79038 80602: Which platform are you guys using for the Cisco assessment?
6/28/23, 11:18 - +91 70445 85513: webex
6/28/23, 11:19 - +91 79038 80602: I have heard that it only allows sharing for 40 mins in one time
6/28/23, 11:19 - +91 79038 80602: <Media omitted>
6/28/23, 11:20 - +91 89775 33160: Heyyy everyone in the group needs to attempt the test from the common mail-id only?
6/28/23, 11:20 - +91 70445 85513: like Cisco Webex (or your preferred tool) they said
6/28/23, 11:20 - +91 70445 85513: so I feel Zoom or gmeet would work
6/28/23, 11:21 - +91 79038 80602: Yeah, I also think so
6/28/23, 11:22 - +91 97521 07631: Test is for 90 mins ??
6/28/23, 11:22 - +91 79038 80602: Yes..Like one team member will attempt the test via Team hackerrank I'd and share his/her screen with other teammates .
6/28/23, 11:23 - +91 79038 80602: 60 mins
6/28/23, 11:56 - +91 89775 33160: So only one team member will have access to hackerrank?
6/28/23, 11:56 - +91 89775 33160: & the remaining will only be able to watch the screen, that's it?
6/28/23, 12:01 - +91 98181 26297: Can we join in google meet
Or we have to do in webx only?
6/28/23, 12:02 - +91 99170 34947: We have to login WebEx using common mail id?
6/28/23, 12:03 - +91 98261 60147: Kitna confusion 🥲
6/28/23, 12:04 - +91 98181 26297: Haan sayad jispr test ka link aaya tha ussi email id se
6/28/23, 12:05 - +91 79038 80602: Yeah ..i think so
Only one would be able to attempt and others will only watch the screen
6/28/23, 12:08 - +91 82391 05885: What's the point of watching the screen, if they can't do anything! Can they help the member in any way like via audio in meeting and contribute to the test?
6/28/23, 12:09 - +91 88009 59923: Discussion and pen paper is allowed
6/28/23, 12:23 - +91 99170 34947: We will get a link to join meeting on WebEx?
6/28/23, 12:23 - +91 99170 34947: Or we have to just start meeting?
6/28/23, 12:24 - +91 99170 34947: And how will they proctor every team member
6/28/23, 12:24 - +91 99170 34947: Since only one team member will access test?
6/28/23, 12:27 - +91 88405 88436: no
6/28/23, 12:28 - +91 88405 88436: they cant, they will only proctor one. they said webex and alternatives, webex is cisco's but alternatives like gmeet arent. so they cant proctor everyone
6/28/23, 12:28 - +91 88405 88436: the proctoring is done by hackerrank so only the person who is takingthe test will be visible
6/28/23, 12:28 - +91 99170 34947: Ok
6/28/23, 12:28 - +91 99170 34947: Thank you for clarification 😊
6/28/23, 12:33 - +91 6206 942 551: anyone who had their coding test today at Samsung Chennai campus 2023 batch ??

6/28/23, 13:35 - +91 96939 27655: exactly
6/28/23, 13:51 - +91 99924 38900: I just tried this, hackerrank allows screen sharing

7/17/23, 22:45 - +91 99872 36851: You can ask for referrals from seniors located in the offices you want. For US you can attend career fairs and networking events virtually and get interviews directly. For Europe you can try through hackathons or apply directly with referral. Usually it helps a lot to have some personal connection. If you’re from a tier 1 college that will increase your chances even more because they usually have flags for top 5 IITs, BITS, IIITH, etc
7/18/23, 01:38 - +91 99170 34947: In my college one of my batchmate has also received the mail for being gdsc lead apart from me what does it meay <This message was edited>

8/21/23, 21:52 - +91 76800 12804: I applied last year. The level was medium-hard. You will be given 4 questions to solve in 90 minutes. Questions are from array, dp and graphs mostly. You need to solve 3.5 questions or more to get the interview link. You can give contests on leetcode and codeforces to help you prepare for the OA.

Interview will be easier than the OA. Practicing questions from leetcode and giving multiple mock interview will definitely help you.

Pls help.
9/1/23, 20:37 - +91 87997 76324: Apply with different email address
9/1/23, 20:38 - +91 87997 76324: I think that was a global program which you applied to at the first place.

9/6/23, 22:53 - +91 93071 43111: but in the question it is what category your result will fall out of 100 so wouldn't it be like what will be your end score in uni out of 100?
9/6/23, 22:55 - +91 73006 62423: I don't think so, they're talking about the normal standard there since marks are calculated out of 100 everywhere. In the question, they're asking how it's *represented* in your college. 
Example- If your college uses the CGPA system out of 10 so look for the GPA 10 option there. <This message was edited>

9/9/23, 12:34 - +91 92896 19143: Minimum Cost to Reach the Destination

There are N cities in a country. George is initially at the airport in city 1 and he wants to reach city N. For any city i, there is either a flight to city (i+1) or to (i+3) if it exists. You have been given an array A with the costs of flight tickets for N cities. To find the cost of a flight ticket between any two cities i and j, you take the absolute difference of the costs of those cities in the array A. You can use the formula [a] = |Cost[i] - Cost[j]] to calculate the cost of a flight ticket, where Jal represents the absolute value of a.

Your task is to find and return the minimum possible cost of flight ticket required to reach the city N.

Note:

The number of cities is always greater than 3.

• Assume 1 based indexing.

9/13/23, 10:39 - +91 95080 46061: *they're good*
That's where the catch lies
9/13/23, 10:39 - +91 99844 43017: Trying won't hurt🥲
9/13/23, 10:39 - +91 81800 79189: Sure let's do that
9/13/23, 10:39 - +91 99844 43017: Yeah
9/13/23, 10:40 - +91 95080 46061: Hopefully so
9/13/23, 10:40 - +91 81800 79189: Can someone send the template for the mail to reschedule
9/13/23, 10:42 - +91 84206 49751: But we also need to ensure that the don't reschedule to the sm day later because we have Atlassian OA that day as well in the evening
9/13/23, 10:42 - +91 99844 43017: Can anyone provide some tips fr DEsis OA, please?
9/13/23, 10:42 - +91 99844 43017: Yeah
9/13/23, 10:43 - +91 99844 43017: It's risky
9/13/23, 10:44 - +91 84206 49751: We need to say for the entire day..like sm people will say they have exams in the morning and others might say they have exams in tbe afternoon-evening slot
9/13/23, 10:44 - +91 84206 49751: Matlab sunday ko karwana hai not saturday
9/13/23, 10:45 - +91 99844 43017: Template plz
9/13/23, 10:45 - +91 84206 49751: Anyone pls send the template🥲

9/13/23, 10:54 - +91 91986 21537: Anyone who didn't get Microsoft OA yet? 2025 batch <This message was edited>
9/13/23, 10:55 - +91 76478 45988: is it offcampus?
9/13/23, 10:56 - +91 91986 21537: Yeah
9/13/23, 10:58 - +91 88405 88436: But then they may not take it as seriously if people mention different slots
9/13/23, 11:03 - +91 84206 49751: Then what's the solution
9/13/23, 11:04 - +91 96610 62738: Sending the same template will lead to your emails ending in spam. Apna apna banake bhejdo we just need to convey the message
9/13/23, 11:05 - +91 84206 49751: But what should be the body of the message, are you chossing the sm time slot for internal exams?
9/13/23, 11:05 - +91 81800 79189: Ok then fix timing
9/13/23, 11:05 - +91 81800 79189: We will change the wording
9/13/23, 11:09 - +91 99844 43017: so we can just say ki our college mid sem exams are going on, so kindly reschedule it on sunday
9/13/23, 11:09 - +91 81800 79189: Oka

9/13/23, 11:14 - +91 81800 79189: Yes I guess so
9/13/23, 11:14 - +91 81800 79189: As they have information about about college

9/13/23, 17:23 - +91 84206 49751: Are you sure?  Someone said it was for 2 hrs last yr
9/13/23, 17:23 - +91 83030 35360: Let's ask them to shift it to the next day

9/17/23, 20:43 - +91 98983 13121: Lastly, help me out girls by picking your preference. Lately I have received many messages complaining about the message spam in our groups.

People find it difficult to filter out important info. Earlier, Codess was operating on discord. We had separate dedicated channels for various topics and discussions. This helped a lot to streamline things and  keep the chats clutter free.

So, would you like Codess to shift back to discord?

Greetings from PayPal University Team!

I hope this message finds you well. We are writing to inform you regarding the scheduled FTE tests for Data Science and Software Engineer 2024 graduates. *Unfortunately, we must cancel the test which is scheduled for next week, due to unforeseen events and internal decisions as the position is on hold* . Be rest assured that this decision has been made after careful consideration keeping the best interests of both students and the campus in mind & we apologize for the inconvenience caused! 

In the meantime, we want to assure you that all other tests (Intern tests), as per the original schedule, will take place as planned.
We remain committed to providing a fair and transparent process for all applicants.

Thanks for understanding!!
